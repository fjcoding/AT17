# GIT Playground
This folder can be used to practice git commands. For any change you add, make sure to use your own branch!

# Commit Best Practices
As best practices, commit must follow the following rules:
- Commit messages must be meaningful, it should briefly describe what changes are being commited
- Commit messages must be simple, it should not be longer than 100 chars long
- Commit changes must be small, for example, instead of push changes in 10 files in one single commit, try to identify smaller groups of changes that can be separated in multiple commits, say first commit modifies 1 file, second commit modifies 3 files, third commit modifies 2 files, fourth commit modifies 4 files.

Example of GOOD commit message
```
Add best practices for commit messages in README file
```

Example of BAD commit message
```
Add changes to README
```

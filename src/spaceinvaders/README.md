# Space Invaders

## Problem Description
Aliens from space are invading the earth, what would we do?

Space invaders group in the sky and move together synchronously from top to bottom in a quest for trying to conquer earth. They randomly shot in earth direction where one spaceship will try to stop them.

Incomplete list of things the game needs:
- group of aliens moving from top to bottom, swinging from side to side, shoot to spaceship
- spaceship moving in one line at the bottom, shoots to aliens
- blocks that can be used as protection, but that deteriorates with each hit from any shoot
- super alien ships moving at the top of the screen, they do not attack, but give extra points if hit by spaceship

## Requirements

### Iteration 1
- The console should be able to print space invaders game with elements listed above. A default template can be used for invaders and blocks
- The game should not be "playable", instead, it should have autonomy in the sense that runs by itself. For example, spaceship moves in its base line randomly from side to side, shooting from time to time in aliens direction.
- Basic rules of the game should apply
    - Every time a spaceship shoot hits an alien, the alien dies and disappears. The spaceship wins points
    - If spaceship gets hit by aliens, it loses a life and moves back to initial position. If all lifes are lost, the game is over
    - If spaceship hits a super alien ship, extra points are won
    - If the last alien alive is hit, spaceship wins
    - If aliens reach spaceship position, spaceship loses a life and game restarts
